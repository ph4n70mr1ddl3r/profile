================================================================================
                         NEXT STEPS FOR TEAM
================================================================================

1. DEVELOPMENT PLANNING
   - Use epic sequencing to plan sprints
   - Epic 1 is prerequisite for all others
   - Epic 2 and Epic 1 can have parallel UI work
   - Epic 3 requires both Epics 1 & 2 complete

2. TEAM ASSIGNMENT
   - Assign stories to developers based on epic
   - Suggest: 1-2 devs on Epic 1, others can start Epic 2 UI work
   - After Epic 1 complete: Full team moves to Epic 3

3. TESTING STRATEGY
   - Epic 1: Unit tests for crypto, storage, auth
   - Epic 2: Integration tests for lobby state
   - Epic 3: E2E tests for signing, verification, edge cases
   - Epic 4: UI tests for drill-down, details display

4. IMPLEMENTATION ORDER
   - Start Epic 1: Foundation (6 stories, ~2-3 weeks)
   - Parallel: Epic 2 UI design while Epic 1 backend
   - After Epic 1: Full team on Epic 3 (8 stories, core value)
   - Epic 4: Final polish (4 stories, ~1 week)
