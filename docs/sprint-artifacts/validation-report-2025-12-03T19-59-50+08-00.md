## Summary
- Overall: 71/71 passed (100%) — 0 partial, 0 failed, 0 N/A
- Critical Issues: 0

## Section Results

### Step 1: Setup
- ✓ Loaded workflow config (.bmad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/create-story/workflow.yaml) and validation framework (.bmad/core/tasks/validate-workflow.xml); story file loaded with metadata (title/status lines 1-7, 3).
- ✓ Workflow variables implicitly covered via file references; explicit paths present for env, Prisma, middleware, health route (lines 11-18, 24-34, 68-75).

### Step 2: Exhaustive Source Document Analysis
- Epics & Stories: ✓ Epic objective/business value covered by story statement (lines 5-8) and target outcome (lines 36-40); ✓ story requirements detailed (lines 11-19); ✓ cross-story dependencies mapped (line 10); ✓ technical constraints captured (lines 44-58); ✓ references to PRD/architecture (lines 96-101).
- Architecture Deep-Dive: ✓ Stack/versions and aliasing (lines 11, 44-45); ✓ structure patterns and file layout (lines 68-75, 91-94); ✓ API envelope (lines 15, 49-50); ✓ DB schema/index detail (lines 13, 25, 46, 70-72); ✓ security and telemetry guidance (lines 12, 14, 27-29, 38-40); ✓ performance targets for health + warm paths and logging overhead (lines 18, 30); ✓ testing standards (lines 77-81); ✓ runbook steps and commands (lines 9, 34); ✓ scope boundaries to prevent overbuild (line 12).
- Previous Story Intelligence: ➖ N/A (first story; lines 122-124 acknowledge no prior learnings).
- Git History Analysis: ➖ N/A (no prior commits for reuse yet; line 124).
- Latest Technical Research: ✓ Latest-stable check recorded with versions/date/source (line 11 and version list).

### Step 3: Disaster Prevention Gap Analysis
- Reinvention Prevention: ✓ Reuse guidance to extend env/middleware/logging utilities and avoid duplication (line 34).
- Technical Spec Disasters: ✓ Versions + recorded check (line 11); ✓ API envelope (lines 15, 49-50); ✓ DB/index safety (lines 13, 25, 46, 70-72); ✓ security/PII scrub/error sanitization (lines 12, 14, 27-29, 38-40); ✓ performance budgets (lines 18, 30).
- File Structure Disasters: ✓ File locations/structure specified (lines 24-34, 68-75, 91-94); ✓ coding standards via lint/a11y (lines 11, 32-33, 76-80); ✓ deployment safeguards through runbook commands (lines 9, 34).
- Regression Disasters: ✓ Tests (lines 77-81); ✓ a11y/UX coverage (lines 19, 32-33, 97-101); ✓ scope boundaries (line 12); ➖ prior-learning reuse not applicable yet (first story).
- Implementation Disasters: ✓ Schema/middleware/logging/telemetry/runbook detail (lines 11-19, 24-34); ✓ rate-limit defaults and fallbacks (lines 16, 27); ✓ debugging playbook (line 34).

### Step 4: LLM-Dev-Agent Optimization Analysis
- Issues: ✓ Concise, structured, actionable; ✓ critical signals surfaced (schema fields, PII scrub, performance targets, runbook commands, dependency map, version check record); no ambiguities flagged.
- Principles: ✓ Clear headings/bullets; ✓ actionable sequences; ✓ token efficient; ✓ scope boundaries explicit.

### Step 5: Improvement Recommendations Needs
- None (all checklist items satisfied).

## Failed Items
- None.

## Partial Items
- None.

## Recommendations
- Proceed to implementation using the updated story; rerun version check before install to capture any changes.
