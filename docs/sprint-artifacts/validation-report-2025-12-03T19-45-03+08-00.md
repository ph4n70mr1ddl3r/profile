## Summary
- Overall: 6/8 passed (75%)
- Critical Issues: 0

## Section Results

### Critical Mistakes to Prevent
Pass Rate: 6/8 (75%)
- ✓ Reinventing wheels avoided; reuses architecture stack and patterns (lines 39-46, 49-53).
- ✓ Wrong file locations avoided; file structure requirements explicit (lines 63-70).
- ⚠ Wrong libraries/version specificity: libraries listed but versions not pinned (lines 54-62).  
  Impact: potential mismatch with target stack; pin versions when initializing.
- ✓ Breaking regressions: not applicable for first story; no prior implementation to break (line 118).
- ⚠ Ignoring UX: references UX doc but no explicit accessibility tasks in AC (lines 93-96).  
  Impact: later UX alignment could be missed during bootstrap; add lint/style tokens to support WCAG.
- ✓ Vague implementations avoided; concrete tasks and AC enumerated (lines 11-17, 21-29).
- ✓ Lying about completion guarded via ready-for-dev status and tasks to execute (lines 3, 21-29, 117).
- ✓ Not learning from past work: N/A for first story and noted (line 118).

### Disaster Prevention Gap Analysis
Pass Rate: 2/3 (67%)
- ✓ File structure disasters mitigated with explicit paths (lines 63-70).
- ✓ API envelope and telemetry requirements captured (lines 15, 39-46).
- ⚠ Latest tech research absent; versions and security advisories not captured due to no network research.  
  Impact: may miss breaking changes; add pinned versions and changelog check step.

## Failed Items
- None (no ✗ items).

## Partial Items
- Library versions and latest tech research not specified; add pinned versions for Next.js, Prisma, NextAuth, Redis client, Sentry.
- UX/accessibility hooks not in acceptance criteria; consider adding baseline lint/style tokens to ensure WCAG alignment during bootstrap.

## Recommendations
1. Must Fix: pin baseline library versions and note source of version checks (offline or manual once network allowed).
2. Should Improve: add explicit accessibility linting/token setup task (align with UX doc).
3. Consider: add a TODO to re-run latest tech research when network access is available.
