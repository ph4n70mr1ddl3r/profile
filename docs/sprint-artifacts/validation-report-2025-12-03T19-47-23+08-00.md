## Summary
- Overall: 9/9 passed (100%)
- Critical Issues: 0

## Section Results

### Critical Mistakes to Prevent
Pass Rate: 6/6 (100%)
- ✓ Reinventing wheels avoided; leans on architecture stack and patterns (lines 39-46).
- ✓ Wrong libraries/version specificity addressed: baseline pins and re-check note added (lines 11-17, 54-62).
- ✓ Wrong file locations avoided; explicit file structure requirements (lines 63-70).
- ✓ Breaking regressions: N/A (first story; no prior implementation) (line 118).
- ✓ Ignoring UX: accessibility/WCAG hooks added to AC and tasks (lines 11-17, 93-96).
- ✓ Vague implementations avoided; concrete AC and task list defined (lines 11-17, 21-29).
- ✓ Lying about completion guarded via ready-for-dev status and task checklist (lines 3, 21-29, 117).
- ✓ Not learning from past work: N/A for first story and noted (line 118).

### Disaster Prevention Gap Analysis
Pass Rate: 3/3 (100%)
- ✓ File structure disasters mitigated with explicit paths (lines 63-70).
- ✓ API envelope and telemetry requirements captured (lines 15, 39-46).
- ✓ Latest tech research/versions captured via TODO and baseline pins (lines 11-17, 21-29, 54-62).

## Failed Items
- None (no ✗ items).

## Partial Items
- None.

## Recommendations
1. Maintain: Keep baseline version pins documented; re-check when network access is available.
2. Maintain: Keep accessibility/WCAG linting and trust-state tokens enforced per UX doc.
3. Maintain: Re-run version/security check when network access is available; adjust pins if needed.
