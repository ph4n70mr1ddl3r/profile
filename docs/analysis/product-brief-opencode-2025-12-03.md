# Product Brief: opencode

<!-- Content will be appended sequentially through collaborative workflow steps -->

## Executive Summary
Opencode is a verification-first trust layer for creator-brand-fan interactions. For micro/nano creators, it delivers auditable authenticity (behavioral integrity, bot/deepfake checks, provenance, periodic re-verification), real-time fraud/anti-deepfake defenses, and diversification triggers so brands get faster, confident decisions. Brands see transparent authenticity scores and alerts that rebalance spend when platform/policy risk or spend concentration spikes.

## Core Vision

### Problem Statement
Micro/nano creators struggle to prove real audiences; brands lack credible, auditable authenticity signals, so deals slow or shrink. Fans want safe, authentic comms. Fragmented platforms and rising fraud/deepfakes make trust expensive and risky.

### Problem Impact
- Brands delay or reduce spend when authenticity proof is weak; ROI risk stays high.
- Creators lose income and trust because follower quality is questioned.
- Fans endure spam/inauthentic interactions; good creators are harder to surface.
- Platform/regulatory shocks force costly channel pivots.

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short
- Vendor metrics aren’t auditable; fraud/deepfake defenses are inconsistent and not real-time.
- Authenticity isn’t a first-class primitive; signals are easy to game.
- Diversification and risk triggers are ad hoc; brands remain overexposed to single-platform risk.
- Comms lack embedded safety signals for creators and fans.

### Proposed Solution
- Authenticity score as a first-class, auditable primitive (behavioral integrity, bot/deepfake checks, provenance) with periodic re-verification and fallback scoring when platform data is limited; privacy-preserving proofs where needed.
- Trust signals surfaced in profiles, campaigns, and reports so brands can greenlight faster.
- Diversification playbooks with triggers (policy change, fraud spike, spend concentration) and recommended rebalancing targets.
- Safe comms/updates with lightweight safety cues (verified sender badge, spam/abuse filters, anomaly alerts) to minimize friction.
- Real-time fraud alerts with options to auto-pause or reallocate budget mid-campaign.

### Key Differentiators
- Auditable authenticity score (explicit inputs, provenance, re-verification cadence), harder to game than vendor metrics; supports privacy-preserving proofs.
- Integrated fraud/deepfake defenses across onboarding, campaign monitoring, and reporting with continuous anomaly detection.
- Triggered diversification guidance to mitigate platform/regulatory shocks and spend concentration risks.
- Trust-first UX: brands see proof, creators keep their voice, fans see safety cues without friction.
