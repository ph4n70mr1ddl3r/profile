# Brainstorming Session Results

**Facilitator:** Riddler
**Date:** 2025-12-03

## Session Overview

**Topic:** Platform for content creators/influencers and their fanbase
**Goals:** Give influencers tools to verify follower authenticity, communicate with followers, share updates, and let brands engage influencers for promotions

### Context Guidance

Context loaded from `.bmad/bmm/data/project-context-template.md`. Focus areas include user pain points, feature ideas, technical approaches, UX, business model/value, differentiation, risks, and success metrics.

### Session Setup

We will prioritize tools for authenticity verification, communication, updates, and brand collaboration to align creators, fans, and advertisers.

## Technique Selection

**Approach:** AI-Recommended Techniques
**Analysis Context:** Platform for content creators/influencers and their fanbase with goals to verify follower authenticity, enable communication/updates, and connect brands with influencers.

**Recommended Techniques:**

- **Question Storming (Deep Analysis):** Surfaces unknowns around authenticity signals, identity proof, and trust flows for creators and brands to frame the right problem space.
- **Role Playing (Collaborative):** Walks perspectives of creators, fans, brands, and platform operators to expose must-have flows, friction points, and trust dynamics.
- **Solution Matrix (Structured):** Maps verification methods × communication modes × brand use cases to prioritize viable combinations and next steps.

**AI Rationale:** Start by uncovering unknowns and constraints, then immerse in multi-actor perspectives to generate grounded ideas, then systematize options to identify strong solution patterns for authenticity, engagement, and brand collaboration.

## Technique Execution Results

**Question Storming (Deep Analysis):**

- **Focus:** Expose unknowns around authenticity signals, journeys, brand proof, and incentives before solutioning.
- **Key questions generated (18):**
  - Trust signals: What proofs will creators/brands actually trust for a follower? Which signals are hardest to fake (payments, devices, social graph, offline proof)? How do we separate legit shared devices/VPNs from farms? What minimal evidence lets a creator act (DM, giveaway, paid shoutout)? How do we recover if verification fails mid-flow?
  - Detection/resilience: What are the top attack patterns (bot farms, bought accounts, resale of verified slots)? How do we detect “verified” resale without harming real fans? What’s the kill switch for abuse that avoids collateral damage? Where could false positives hurt loyal fans most?
  - Journeys: At which moments does authenticity matter most (DMs, collabs, contests, payment flows)? How much friction will fans tolerate before they bounce? How do we let creators tune strictness by context (paid vs. casual)?
  - Brand collaboration: What proof convinces brands to spend (reach quality, engagement authenticity, lift/attribution)? How do we protect creator-brand chats without leaking fan data? How do we show lift/attribution that brands will accept as credible?
  - Incentives/stickiness: Why would creators verify fans instead of just broadcasting? How do we reward fans for proving authenticity without gaming? What keeps this sticky weekly (reputation, perks, faster access)?
- **Next:** Continue with Role Playing to explore stakeholder perspectives, then Solution Matrix to structure options.
