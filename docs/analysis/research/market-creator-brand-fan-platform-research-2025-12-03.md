### Pain Points and Challenges

- Marketers fear inauthentic or overly polished messaging and want to avoid “trend hopping” that feels fake; brands seek authentic, community-driven voices (micro/nano) to sustain trust.  
_Sources: https://later.com/blog/influencer-marketing-trends/ ; https://blog.hootsuite.com/social-media-trends/_

### Decision-Making Processes

- Brands pick platforms/creators that give credible context (LinkedIn for B2B authority) and an authentic tone (micro-influencers, unfiltered posts on Threads/X); transparency and vibe-fit matter more than raw reach.  
_Sources: https://later.com/blog/influencer-marketing-trends/ ; https://blog.hootsuite.com/social-media-trends/_

### Customer Journey Mapping

- Discovery and proof of credibility now happen in-feed via short-form video and creator posts (LinkedIn, Threads/X); community-style engagement (comments, live threads) is where trust is built.

### Customer Satisfaction Drivers

- Audiences reward authentic creator voice, niche relevance, and transparency (e.g., showing process/AI prompts); brands and fans lean toward creators who feel “real” and community-first.

## Customer Pain Points and Needs

### Customer Challenges and Frustrations

- Brands worry about inauthentic or over-produced content and want credible proof of real audiences; overdependence on a single platform (e.g., TikTok) is viewed as risky after a 17.2% drop in marketer investment intent post potential US ban.  
_Source: https://influencermarketinghub.com/influencer-marketing-benchmark-report/_
- Creators and brands face pressure to stay “authentic” on emerging channels (Threads/X), making polished/rigid messaging a liability.  
_Source: https://blog.hootsuite.com/social-media-trends/_

### Unmet Customer Needs

- Trusted audience quality signals (anti-fake/fraud indicators) and transparency on how engagement is verified remain unmet needs for brands.  
_Source: https://influencermarketinghub.com/influencer-marketing-benchmark-report/_
- Creators need lightweight ways to prove authenticity without losing voice; brands want relatable micro/nano partners but need clearer verification.  
_Source: https://later.com/blog/influencer-marketing-trends/_

### Barriers to Adoption

- Platform/regulatory risk (e.g., TikTok investment pullback) creates hesitation and pushes diversification.  
_Source: https://influencermarketinghub.com/influencer-marketing-benchmark-report/_
- Trust barriers: lack of standardized proof against bots/deepfakes; AI-driven deepfake tools (15.4% adoption) raise authenticity concerns.  
_Source: https://influencermarketinghub.com/influencer-marketing-benchmark-report/_
- Convenience barriers: fragmented channels and need to experiment with tone/authenticity on Threads/X raise operational overhead.  
_Source: https://blog.hootsuite.com/social-media-trends/_

### Service and Support Pain Points

- Need better tooling to monitor engagement quality and automate fraud checks; AI adoption (NLP/ML) is rising but deepfake risks complicate support and moderation.  
_Source: https://influencermarketinghub.com/influencer-marketing-benchmark-report/_

### Customer Satisfaction Gaps

- Expectation for authentic, community-led engagement vs. reality of inconsistent tone and perceived inauthenticity on newer channels.  
_Source: https://blog.hootsuite.com/social-media-trends/_
- Value gaps when audience quality proof is weak; brands hesitate to scale spend without trustworthy verification.  
_Source: https://influencermarketinghub.com/influencer-marketing-benchmark-report/_

### Emotional Impact Assessment

- Frustration and risk aversion rise when platform bans or authenticity doubts threaten campaign ROI; loyalty risk emerges if audiences perceive creators as inauthentic.  
_Sources: https://influencermarketinghub.com/influencer-marketing-benchmark-report/ ; https://blog.hootsuite.com/social-media-trends/_

### Pain Point Prioritization

- High: Audience authenticity verification and fraud/deepfake resistance; platform-dependence risk; authenticity of tone/voice.  
- Medium: Operational overhead of multi-platform experimentation (Threads/X) and tone shifts.  
- Low: General content production (solvable with existing tools) relative to trust challenges.

## Customer Decision Processes and Journey

### Customer Decision-Making Processes
